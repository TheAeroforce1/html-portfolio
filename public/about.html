<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am just a man. A simple man. Here to create cool looking websites, quit his job, and live somewhere warm. You
 and I aren't so different, are we? Deep down I'm sure we all want the same things. Money. Autonomy. Freedom. It's all
 right there waiting for us. We just have to take the leap. If you're scared, that's fine. We can take the leap together.
 That's all it is, just one big leap of faith.</p>

<p>I graduated with two bachelor degrees, neither of with have anything to do with computers. I have a BA in Psychology &
 Human Services, and another BA in Political Science. Yep, two degrees for the price of one. I played tennis at the NCAA Division II
 level. In other words, I was super busy, got in, got my scholarships, got my degrees, and got out. Oh, I went to Davis and Elkins College.
 I feel as though that's probably relevant somewhere. </p>

<p>Anyways, I'm ready for something new. I have worked suicide prevention, I am trained to do suicide interventions, I run
  a day program for people who are homeless. I have seen loss. I have seen failures. I have seen success. I have spent so much
  of my time helping other people go from "0 to 1" and I think it's time I do that for myself. </p>
